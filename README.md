### About me

I am an associate professor in the Department of Statistics at Jeonbuk National University. I received my Ph.D. in 2018 under the supervision of Professor Hee-Seok Oh. My research area is multiscale methods, which aims to represent and analyze data from multiple levels or scales. I find multiscale thinking fascinating because it allows us to observe the same data from different perspectives, often leading to new insights. Sometimes, changing the scale of observation can even reverse the conclusion—an effect well illustrated by Simpson’s paradox. The idea of using hierarchical observation tools to interpret data reveals the richness and complexity of statistical reasoning, and that’s what makes multiscale methods so interesting to me.

More recently, I’ve been focusing on multiscale methods for non-Euclidean data, such as manifolds, graphs, simplicial complexes, and other combinatorial representations. While classical multiscale techniques—like Fourier and wavelet transforms—are mostly developed for Euclidean domains, the underlying idea of multiscale analysis is much broader. It is not tied to any specific data structure, but rather to how we observe and decompose information across levels. That’s why developing multiscale methods for non-Euclidean domains is not just a technical extension, but a deeper exploration of what multiscale analysis really means. For me, this is the most exciting part—it pushes us to rethink the foundations of multiscale thinking itself. As a bonus, this line of research also aligns with emerging fields like geometric deep learning and topological deep learning, where non-Euclidean structures are naturally encountered. Comparing their approaches with mine is one of the things I truly enjoy.
